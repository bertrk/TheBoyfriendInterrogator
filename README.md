Despite the name, the Interrogator can be used on anyone. It requires an administrator who will run the code, a person being interrogated, and their significant other.

Files and questions are fully customizable. Default names are level + ".txt", like "personal.txt", but custom file names can be entered.

Option to add custom notes per question.
